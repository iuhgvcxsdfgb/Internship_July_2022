Topic : Set .symmetric_difference() Operation
The .symmetric_difference() operator returns a set with all the elements that are in the set and the iterable but not both.
Sometimes, a ^ operator is used in place of the .symmetric_difference() tool, but it only operates on the set of elements in set.
The set is immutable to the .symmetric_difference() operation (or ^ operation).
