Problem :

You are given a set A and n other sets.
Your job is to find whether set A is a strict superset of each of the N sets.
Print True, if A is a strict superset of each of the N sets. Otherwise, print False.
A strict superset has at least one element that does not exist in its subset.

#Solution


storage = set(input().split())
N = int(input())
output = True

for i in range(N):
    storage2 = set(input().split())
    if not storage2.issubset(storage):
        output = False
    if len(storage2) >= len(storage):
        output = False

print(output)
