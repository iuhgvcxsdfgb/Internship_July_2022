# Topic :- Running Sum of 1d Array
**********************************************`Question`*****************************************************
### Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).
### Return the running sum of nums.
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]<br>
Output: [1,3,6,10]<br>
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].
"""


class Solution:
    def runningSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            nums[i] += nums[i - 1]
        return nums
